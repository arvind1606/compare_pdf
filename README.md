The provided Python function, compare_pdfs, is used to compare two PDF files by extracting their text content and performing a line-by-line comparison between the two documents. Here's a detailed explanation of how the function works:

pdfplumber is a Python library used for extracting text and other information from PDF files. To use it, you need to install it using pip install pdfplumber.

The function takes two arguments: pdf_file1 and pdf_file2, which are the file paths to the two PDF files you want to compare.

Inside the function:

a. It opens the first PDF file (pdf_file1) using pdfplumber.open(pdf_file1) and assigns it to the variable pdf1.

b. It then opens the second PDF file (pdf_file2) using pdfplumber.open(pdf_file2) and assigns it to the variable pdf2.

c. Next, it extracts the text content from both PDFs using list comprehensions:

text1 contains the concatenated text content of all pages in pdf1.
text2 contains the concatenated text content of all pages in pdf2.
d. The extracted text content is split into lines using splitlines(), resulting in two lists of lines: lines1 and lines2. Each line represents a line of text from the respective PDF.

e. To compare the lines from both PDFs, the function uses Python's difflib library, which provides tools for comparing sequences of lines. It creates a Differ object with difflib.Differ(), and then uses it to compare the two lists of lines using differ.compare(lines1, lines2). The result is a list of differences between the two lists of lines.

Finally, the function returns the list of differences (diff) to the caller.

The list of differences (diff) contains lines of text with special markers to indicate differences. The markers include:

" " (space): Lines that are the same in both PDFs.
"-" (minus): Lines that exist in the first PDF but not in the second PDF.
"+" (plus): Lines that exist in the second PDF but not in the first PDF.
By examining the differences in this list, you can identify where the two PDFs differ in terms of text content line by line. This function is helpful for identifying textual differences between PDF files but may not be suitable for detecting structural or formatting differences.
